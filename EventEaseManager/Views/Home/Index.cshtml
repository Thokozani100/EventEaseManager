    <h2>📌 Company Background</h2>
    <p>
        EventEase is an up-and-coming event management company coordinating a variety of events across different venues.
        Due to rapid growth and increasing demand, EventEase has been overwhelmed with managing multiple venue bookings,
        scheduling, and handling booking conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, all scheduling and bookings are managed manually, leading to double bookings, last-minute cancellations,
        and a lack of visibility into venue availability.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Project Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        EventEase has contracted your development team to build an efficient, user-friendly online booking platform to streamline these processes.
        This application simplifies venue management, prevents booking conflicts, and provides a clear view of scheduled events.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system enables booking specialists to make bookings on behalf of customers who request via email, phone, or walk-in.
        Events can be loaded before a venue becomes available, allowing bookings to be made once availability is confirmed.
    </p>

    <h2>🛠️ System Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Browse available venues, view events, and manage bookings</li>
        <li>Create, view, update, and delete venue and event information</li>
        <li>Secure image uploads for venues</li>
        <li>Prevent double bookings and restrict deletion of linked venues/events</li>
        <li>Store booking data securely in the cloud with backups</li>
        <li>Track location, capacity, names, dates, and unique booking IDs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 Future Vision</h2>
    <p>
        EventEase envisions integrating this platform with cloud services for seamless scaling and advanced automation.
